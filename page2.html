                 <p> Delantic Davis, also known as Gucci Mane, was born on Feburary 12,1980. Delantic comes from Birmingham,Alanta and from a single mother family. As a child in elementary, he loved to write peotry. Gucci began rapping 
at 14 years old. Gucci is 6'1 and is covered from head-to-toe in tattoos. However, one specific tattoo of a ice cream cone on his face is his legendary trademark. Gucci loves ice cream,hence why he got the tattoo and his catcall 
"burr burr." Gucci Mane has been in several movies including "Spring Breakers", "Rap-Hustling" and "Grind or Die." In 2003, Gucci signed to Big Cat Records after his single "Black Tee" to diss " White Tee" by Dem Franchize Boyz .
Gucci was in jail  for assault in late 2005. Gucci was also charged with murder, although charges were dropped after the crime was labeled as self-defense. After being released from jail in 2010, Gucci decided to to change So Icey ENT 
to 1017 Bricksquad! 1017 Bricksquad! consists of Waka Flocka Flame, Young Thug, Frenchie and many more. On Feburary 12,2015 Gucci released Brick Factory 2. He's relased albums 
back to album in 2015 including Trap House 4 and1017 Mafia:Incarcerated.
                 <p>I like Gucci Mane music because I can relate to his lyrics, especially about songs about his "soldier mother" like "Mama." Gucci Mane also influences me to do get my money up for my family In the song "Mama" one 
of his lyrics are "chill momma, cause we been broke a long time.." Although Gucci has a way with derogatory language, I enjoy his music. I also like his humor in his songs. For example, he says " beefing about a b**** with a glued
on bun...."
