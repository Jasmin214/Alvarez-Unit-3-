                  <p>Li Lianjie ,better known as Jet Li, was born on April 26,1963 in Beijing. He ia an actor and a martial artist.. When Jet Li was young, his parents noted his talent 
in Wushu,a form of martial arts. "I was from a very poor family and we didn't have enough money for a good school so his parents sent me to a sports school. It was good 
, it gave me good food and an opportunity out of China," Jet Li told an interviewer of Muscle And Fitness magazine. Jet Li was 17 when he first appeared on a movie called
"Shaolin Temple". He has 2 kids with Huang Quyan. In 2004, there was a tsunami where he nearly died. From that experience, he decided to form his own foundation called 
"The One Foundation", which supports diaster relief including health awareness. 
                 <p> i really, really love and admire Jet Li ever since I was a little girl. He's one of my family's favorite actors, therefore I grew up watching Jet-Li. 
Alot of people think it's "crazy" how I love Jet-Li. I think it's crazy how they fail to see how much I love Jet-Li as an actor.I also think he's soooooo cutee :)
